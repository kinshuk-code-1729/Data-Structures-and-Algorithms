# This repository contains some basic programs of Data Structures in C/C++ and various algorithms involved in them.
## üéÜ What is a data structure ?
- A data structure is a special way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
- **Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph** etc are all basic data structures in C/C++ that stores the data in a special way so that we can access and use the data efficiently.

## üéá Why do we need data structures?
- Data structures are used in almost every program or software system.
- Specific data structures are essential ingredients of many efficient algorithms, and make possible the management of huge amounts of data, such as large integrated collection of databases.
- In software design, Data structures are known to be major factors for collection, storing and organizing of data rather than algorithms in some programming languages.
- Often Data structures are used in the combination of algorithms.

## ‚ú® How are data structures used in programming language?
- The data structure is not any programming language like _C, C++, Java,_ etc.
- It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.
- To structure the data in memory, **_'n'_** number of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types.

## ‚≠ê Classification of Data Structure:

- **Linear data structure:** Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

_Examples of linear data structures are [array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array/), [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack/), [queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue/), [linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/), etc._
  - **Static data structure:** Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 

_An example of this data structure is an [array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array/)._
  - **Dynamic data structure:** In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 

_Examples of this data structure are [queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue/), [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack/), etc._
- **Non-linear data structure:** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can‚Äôt traverse all the elements in a single run only. 

_Examples of non-linear data structures are [trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-data-structure/) and [graphs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)._
