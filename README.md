# This repository contains some basic programs of Data Structures in C/C++ and various algorithms involved in them.
## ðŸŽ† What is a data structure ?
- A data structure is a special way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
- Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph etc are all basic data structures in C/C++ that stores the data in a special way so that we can access and use the data efficiently.
## * Why do we need data structures?
- Data structures are used in almost every program or software system.
- Specific data structures are essential ingredients of many efficient algorithms, and make possible the management of huge amounts of data, such as large integrated collection of databases.
- In software design, Data structures are known to be major factors for collection, storing and organizing of data rather than algorithms in some programming languages.
- Often Data structures are used in the combination of algorithms.
## * How are data structures used in programming language?
- The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc.

- It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.

- To structure the data in memory, 'n' number of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types.
